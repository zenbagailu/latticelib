/**
* Extension of the LatticeCell class for 2D, with definitions for most commons 2D neighbourhoods. 
* These include the VonNeumann and Moore neighbourhoods, as well as a neighbourhood consisting of 
* the cells at the corners of the current cell. These neighbourhoods are described using the simple 
* convention of enumerate the neighbours from left to right, and top to bottom, that may allow to 
* pair them with values of for example convolution filters and other data specific to each neighbour.
* The diagonalNeigs() and vonNeumannNeigs() methods, however, allow to separate the cells in their
*  most typical categories.
